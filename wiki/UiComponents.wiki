Before mentioned widgets include:
  * An [http://code.google.com/p/oxeniphonecommons/source/browse/trunk/main/Classes/UI/Accordion/ accordion] control. It allows adding N sections, each one with an arbitrary UIView which is shown/hidden clicking a button.
  * An [http://code.google.com/p/oxeniphonecommons/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fmain%2FClasses%2FUI%2FInteractiveSelector interactive selector], which allows selecting/unselecting options. Options are shown horizontally and can be scrolled. It also can act as delegate for a search bar, in order to filter options.
