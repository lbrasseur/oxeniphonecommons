Components in this section include:
  * [http://code.google.com/p/oxeniphonecommons/source/browse/trunk/main/Classes/Dictionary/OxICJDictionaryConverter.m OxICJDictionaryConverter], which reads properties from an object and copies it recursively into dictionaries. It relies on [http://code.google.com/p/oxeniphonecommons/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fmain%2FClasses%2FWrapper class wrapper] in order to acces and enumerate properties. The only restriction is that the object can't contain cyclic references.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/oxeniphonecommons/source/browse/trunk/main/Classes/Dictionary/OxICJDictionaryProxy.m OxICJDictionaryProxy], which allows accessing a dictionary through standar "setter/getter" methods in a protocol/class.
