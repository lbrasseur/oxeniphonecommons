# Introduction #

This project has an [UI components](http://code.google.com/p/oxeniphonecommons/source/browse/trunk/main/Classes/UI/) section. It contains UI widgets that we developed for specific requirements.


# Details #

Before mentioned widgets include:
  * A generic [view utils](http://code.google.com/p/oxeniphonecommons/source/browse/trunk/main/Classes/UI/ViewUtils/OxICViewUtils.m) class.
  * An [accordion](http://code.google.com/p/oxeniphonecommons/source/browse/trunk/main/Classes/UI/Accordion/) control. It allows adding N sections, each one with an arbitrary UIView which is shown/hidden clicking a button.
  * An [interactive selector](http://code.google.com/p/oxeniphonecommons/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fmain%2FClasses%2FUI%2FInteractiveSelector), which allows selecting/unselecting options. Options are shown horizontally and can be scrolled. It also can act as delegate for a search bar, in order to filter options.
  * [Popup pickers](http://code.google.com/p/oxeniphonecommons/source/browse/trunk/main/Classes/UI/PopupPicker) for:
    * [Date and time](http://code.google.com/p/oxeniphonecommons/source/browse/trunk/main/Classes/UI/PopupPicker/OxICPopupDatePicker.m) (or both)
    * [Lists](http://code.google.com/p/oxeniphonecommons/source/browse/trunk/main/Classes/UI/PopupPicker/OxICPopupListPicker.m) (with key-value, pretty much like a combo).
